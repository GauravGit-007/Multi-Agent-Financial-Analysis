# Multi-Agent Financial Analysis Project

Welcome! This project is designed to make financial, sentiment, and news analysis on Indian stocks easy and reproducible for anyone‚Äîeven beginners.

## üîé What Does It Do?

This system:
- Fetches daily stock price data for chosen companies (e.g., Reliance, TCS)
- Gathers recent headline news for those companies
- Analyzes news sentiment (positive/negative/neutral)
- Merges all data, adds basic economic indicators
- Automatically generates BUY/SELL/HOLD recommendations
- Saves output as CSV and Excel for easy viewing

***

## üí° How The Workflow Works

Here‚Äôs the full pipeline in simple steps:

1. **Data Fetching**  
   - **fetch_real_data.py**: Downloads stocks, headlines, and basic economic stats.
   - Output:  
     `stock_prices.csv`  
     `news_articles.csv`  
     `economic_indicators.csv`

2. **(Optional) Data Cleaning**  
   - For custom/wide CSV formats, run:  
     **clean_stock_data.py**, **fix_stock_format.py**  
     Output:  
     `stock_prices_clean.csv`

3. **Data Merging**  
   - **full_pipeline.py**: Combines all into one well-structured file.
   - Output:  
     `final_combined.csv`  
     `final_combined.xlsx`

4. **Recommendation Generation**  
   - **decision_agent.py**: Reads merged file and generates simple signals based on sentiment and price trend.
   - Output:  
     `recommendations.csv`

5. **Orchestrator Script**  
   - **run_all_agents.py**: Runs all steps above‚Äîfrom fetch to recommendation‚Äîwith one command.

## üö¶ How To Set Up and Run (Step-by-Step)

### 1. Prerequisites

- Python 3.8‚Äì3.12 installed
- Optional: `git` if you want to clone from GitHub

### 2. (Recommended) Virtual Environment

Open PowerShell or Terminal and type:
```powershell
python -m venv .venv
& ".venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1"
```

### 3. Install Requirements

Make sure you're in your project folder with `requirements.txt`, then run:
```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run The Whole Pipeline

```powershell
python run_all_agents.py
```

This will:
- Fetch stock/news/economic data
- Merge everything
- Generate recommendations
- Print success messages and save outputs

## üìä What Are The Outputs?

After running, check your project folder for:
- `stock_prices.csv`
- `news_articles.csv`
- `economic_indicators.csv`
- `final_combined.csv`
- `final_combined.xlsx`
- `recommendations.csv` (main output for decision)

## üßπ Resetting The Project

Want to clean up all generated output?  
Run:
```powershell
python square_one.py
```
*(This will delete all `.csv` and `.xlsx` output files in the folder for a fresh start.)*

***

## üÜò FAQ & Troubleshooting

- Missing library? Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (in your virtual environment).
- Error writing Excel? Add `openpyxl` to `requirements.txt` and install‚Äîthen re-run.
- Still stuck? Check your Python version, file locations, and activation steps.

***

## üöÄ Modifying or Extending

- To analyze new tickers, edit arguments in `run_all_agents.py` or pass extra tickers to `fetch_real_data.py`.
- Each script is commented and easy to customize.
